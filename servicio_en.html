            <p>Welcome to our Terms and Conditions of Use. This document establishes the terms and conditions for the use of our services.</p>

            <p>
                Criminalisticaok was created in September 2022 with the intention of providing a digital space for the dissemination and collaboration among professionals, students, and enthusiasts of Criminalistics. The project is developed under the current legal framework in the Argentine Republic and respects the fundamental principles of the Intellectual Property Law and other applicable regulations.
                <br>
                <br>
                This site is free of charge and is designed to facilitate access to information, news, training activities, and specialized content in criminalistics and related disciplines.
            </p>

                <h2><b>Purpose of the Site</b></h2>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this platform is to promote learning in the field of criminalistics and to give visibility to the valuable work carried out by experts and professionals in related areas and branches. Criminalisticaok also seeks to strengthen the social recognition of forensic work and to raise awareness about its impact on the administration of Justice.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Contributions and Participation</h2>
            <p>Content contributions to the site (articles, news, suggestions for courses or events) are welcome and valued. Anyone who wishes to collaborate may do so voluntarily, communicating through our official social networks or through the institutional email.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our approach is based on reciprocity: just as we access information shared by others, we are also open to disseminating resources that may benefit the forensic community.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Copyright and Third-Party Content</h2>

In cases where authorship cannot be verified, we will proceed with caution, indicating the source if available.
            <br>
            <br>

If any person considers that content included on the site infringes their copyright, they may notify us immediately through our official channels. We will review the case promptly and, if applicable, remove the material from the site without delay.
